SMS Import / Export is a sibling project to <a href="https://github.com/tmo1/sms-db">sms-db</a>, a Linux tool to build an SQLite database out of collections of SMS and MMS messages in various formats. sms-db will hopefully eventually be able to import ZIP files created by SMS Import / Export, and to export its database to ZIP files that can be imported by SMS Import / Export.
